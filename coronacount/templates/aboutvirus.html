            <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.
              In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the
              common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
              Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes
              coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>

            <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.<br> Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
